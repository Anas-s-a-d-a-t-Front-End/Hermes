            Cham Wings Airlines currently organizes regular 
            flights to many destinations that meet the needs of 
            its customers, especially in areas where the Syrian communities
             are spread, such as Sharjah, Moscow, Beirut, Yerevan, Kuwait and other Arab
              and international cities.. With the launch of its flights to and from Damascus 
              International Airport and Aleppo International Airport and Lattakia Airport, it 
              contributes to reducing the many difficulties 
              that travelers were facing while moving to 
            foreign destinations or during their return to their home country.
